Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.

high-level programming language -> Machine level language.

Machine level language -> 0s and 1s. (binary)

Python Programming Language -> Implementations -> Operative System -> Processor

Implementations:
- CPython -> C
- Jython -> Java
- IronPython -> .NET -> C#
- PyPy -> RPython -> Python
- Brython -> JavaScript

Why CPython? 
- It is the most popular implementation of Python.
- Created by Python.
- All new python features are implemented in CPython first.

Example in Java:

    Java -> Machine language -> this is complicated because it depends of the OS and the processor.

    NEW or BETTER

    Java -> Compiler -> Bytecode -> JVM -> Machine language 

Example in Python:

    Python -> Compiler -> Bytecode -> PVM -> Machine language 

WHY THIS INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT?

    - It helps us to understand how Python works.
    - It helps us to understand how Python is different from other programming languages.
    - We now that We can use different platforms to run Python code.
    - We can use libraries that are written in other languages.
